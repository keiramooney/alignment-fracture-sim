# Alignment Fracture Simulation

This repo contains my summer project to simulate alignment fractures in multi-agent systems.

## Goals
- Simulate behavior divergence between aligned and misaligned agents.
- Study emergent misalignment in multi-agent interactions.
- Visualize how reward hacking and goal drift occur over time.

## Current Structure
- `simulation/` - simulation logic (network generation, belief updates)
- `agents/` - initial belief configuration
- `eval/` - visualization tools
- `notebooks/` - early prototyping, exploratory code
- `logs/` - tracking experimental runs/results 

## 
Future Plans
- Custom agent behaviors (stubbornness, noise, etc)
- Different network types (especially scale-free, small-world)
- Dynamic visualizations and metric tracking

## Note
Because it is still in the early stages, the structure and code is subject to change as I learn more throughout the process.
