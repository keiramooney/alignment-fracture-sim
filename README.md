# Alignment Fracture Simulation

This repo contains my summer project to simulate alignment fractures in multi-agent systems.

## Goals
- Simulate behavior divergence between aligned and misaligned agents.
- Study emergent misalignment in multi-agent interactions.
- Visualize how reward hacking and goal drift occur over time.

## Current Structure
- `simulation/` 
- `agents/` 
- `eval/` 
- `notebooks/` 
- `logs/` 

## Note
Because it is still in the early stages, the structure and code is subject to change as I learn more throughout the process.
